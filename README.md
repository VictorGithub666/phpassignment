# Abstact Classes

# Classes that are used only when needed by other classes


# Uses
# Abstract classes are used when you want to define a common base structure for a group of related classes

# Interfaces 

# It's a blue print that we use in order to group specific classes in order to tell them how to bahave.

# Significances
# 1. Provides flexible design for large systems.
# 2. Provides multiple inheritance of Classes.

# Traits

# A group of functions or properties for code re-use allowing you to include methods in classes without needing inheritance.

# Differences
# 1. Traits cannot be instanciated hence can be used to inject methods into classes
# 2. Traits provide actual methods with actual code that can be used inside classes while interfaces only define the methods without the code

# Static Methods & Properties

# Static Methods & Properties belong to the class itself.

# Use Cases
# 1. Used for singleton design patterns to ensure that only one instance of a class exists during execution.
# 2. Can be used to keep track of global information.
# 3. Can hold configuration values or settings that need to be shared across the class without needing to instantiate it.

# Namespaces

# Is a way of encapsulating code in order to avoid naming conflicts.

# Importance
# 1. Helps in avoiding naming conflicts.
# 2. Organizes code in grouping related functionality together.

# Iterables

# Datatypes that can be iterated over in a loop.

# Applications
# 1. Can be used in looping over data structures.
# 2. Can be used to iterate over large data sets without loading everything into memory at once.
